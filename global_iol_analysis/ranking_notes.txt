GPT 4

Ask-the-language prompt

Dyirbal
it picks up Australian Aboriginal, but thinks this is a fictional language because of the regularity of morphemes (??)
its guess (Yolngu) is not right and not super related

Norwegian
Gets it exactly right (and also identifies the phenomenon Exactly)

Blackfoot
Gets it exactly right 

Luiseno
Yaps for 4 paragraphs about why it is a constructed language
and then finally vaguely guesses “a family of Indigenous languages, possibly from the Americas” which is right, but no further

Madak
Guesses Austronesian because lu = two (whoa), correct
then Oceanic, which is also correct
cannot get any more specific than that

Yonggom
Gets it completely wrong (guesses it is a constructed language, with extra bonus yapping!)

Chickasaw
Guesses Choctaw (VERY close relative, lots of shared vocab) and explains why w/ grammatical features

Euskara
Gets it right 

Wambaya
Guesses Australian Aboriginal → Pama-Nyungan so not very close  (Wambaya is NPN!)

Basque
Gets it right
