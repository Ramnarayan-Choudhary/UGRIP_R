1. This is a linguistics puzzle. The given pair of english to unknown language translations are as follows:
    Note that the translation pairs are written in json format.

    {"train": [
  [
    "Meneni karuwa anona wedmaan.",
    "I came and saw the man and the dog."
  ],
  [
    "Wingkeewa yeediriin.",
    "You.SG sing and I get up."
  ],
  [
    "Ambib wedmoona awon baan.",
    "He saw the house and I took the pig."
  ],
  [
    "Yeederenu om banuun.",
    "She will get up and will take the bread."
  ],
  [
    "Wenenub wingkanuub.",
    "We will go away and will sing."
  ],
  [
    "Oma oka aniib.",
    "They eat the bread and drink the water."
  ],
  [
    "Anon ye weng wengambaranuuwa awon ye weng wengambaraneen.",
    "We will hear the dog and he will hear the pig."
  ],
  [
    "Ok anaana oon wedmeen.",
    "I drank the water and she saw the fish."
  ],
  [
    "Yeederenib miniib.",
    "They get up and come."
  ],
  [
    "Wingkenu wunuun.",
    "She sings and goes away."
  ],
  [
    "Om bene aneen.",
    "He takes the bread and eats it."
  ]
]}

    2. Here, each pair of the problem statement gives you the unknown language and its respective translation in the target language. complete the missing slots in the following "test" problem set, also in .json file.
    
    The following json is called "test_problem_set":

    {"test": [
  [
    "Om benu aneen",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Munuuna wunuub.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Wingkiiwa wengamburuun.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Anon ye weng wengamberenib yeedaraniib.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Oon wedmaniina karub wedmaneeb.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Ok wedmeena aniin.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "We will go away and they will come.",
    "<"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "I take the pig and he takes the fish.",
    "<"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "He saw the water and the house and heard the dog.",
    "<"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "You.SG eat the bread and sing.",
    "<"
  ]
]}

    3. Here are some explanaions of the problem statement above:
    In the JSON file, you will see many lists of 3 elements
    Each list element would have two formats:

    Option 1: ["", "two languages", "<"]. The "<" means that the english translation is given.
    So you are supposed to translate "two languages", which is an english statement, into the unknwon language. 
    Then, fil in the answer at the first element in the list, "". 
    Do not change element 2 and 3, which are "two languages" and "<" respectively.

    Option 2: you might see ["ewriwurweir", "", ">"]. The ">" means that the translation in the unknown language is given. 
    Then you're supposed to fill in the english translation in the second element, at "". 
    The first element, "ewriwurweir", and the third element, ">", should not be changed.

    4. Go through all the 3-element lists, then answer the questions, depending on which way you see the ">" or "<".
    Only populate the missing "" in any given 3-element list. Do not modify the order of the list elements, either.
   
    5. Output the completed JSON, strictly follow the structure of the JSON template.
    Again, make sure that all the elements are in the same order as the "test_problem_set", with only the "" fields populated, whereever they may be.

Please look at your previous response, then compare line-by-line with the following template:

{"test": [
  [
    "Om benu aneen",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Munuuna wunuub.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Wingkiiwa wengamburuun.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Anon ye weng wengamberenib yeedaraniib.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Oon wedmaniina karub wedmaneeb.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "Ok wedmeena aniin.",
    "",
    ">"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "We will go away and they will come.",
    "<"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "I take the pig and he takes the fish.",
    "<"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "He saw the water and the house and heard the dog.",
    "<"
  ],
  [
    "",
    "You.SG eat the bread and sing.",
    "<"
  ]
]}

Make sure that your response is exacetly in the same format. 

In every 3-element sub-list in this json file, do the following.
If you see the third element being "<", then your use your translation result in the "unknown language" in the 1st element in the list, which replaces the "" placeholder.
If you see the third element being ">", then your use your translation result in english in the 2nd element in the list, which replaces the "" placeholder.

Keep all elements that are already populated intact.

Please output the json again. No need to wrap it around "```json" and "```".
