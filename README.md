# ugrip24-ling

## Project Description
The "Can LLMs Ace the Linguistic Olympiad" project is part of the 2024 Undergraduate Research Internship Program (UGRIP) at MBZUAI. The objectives are:

### Week 1 (06/03 - 06/09)
- Build the experimental pipeline
- Benchmark several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as Llama-3 and Chat-GPT4 on the problem-solving capabilities of the International Lingistic Olympiad (IOL) problems, especially Rosetta-Stone
- Design custom prompts for phonology problems, syntax (Rosetta Stone), and more
- Evaluate performances with prompt-tuning
- Research on data contamination detection and problem-content encryption methods
- Experiment with evaluation metrics

### Week 2 (06/10 - 06/16)
- Artificial language generation and code-simulation recovery
- Tree of thought prompting setup
- Multi-turn interactions (does giving hints improve the performance? Human in the loop)

## Required Packages
- `pip install transformers`
