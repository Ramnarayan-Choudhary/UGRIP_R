I apologize for the confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to execute or test Python code or any other programming language code. My responses are generated based on patterns and information available up to my last training data, and I do not have the capability to dynamically run code to verify its correctness.

If you need assistance with writing or debugging Python code, I can provide guidance, explanations, and code examples based on best practices and my training data. However, you would need to run and test the code in your own Python environment to verify its correctness and make any necessary adjustments based on the output.
