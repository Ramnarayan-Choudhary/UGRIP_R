>>>> Prompt 1 >>>>
Hello, I have the following English sentences. Can you help me find the subject nouns in each?

For example, the subject noun in "I am riding a bicycle" would be "I".
Subject nouns in "He does not like her" will be "he" and "her". 
"The dog is barking" would have "dog".

Ok, here are more sentences for you to process:

1. "She puts a table on his hair."
2. "George is very bored."
2. "Please let me know if this works."
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-----------------------------------------
Certainly! Let's identify the subject nouns in each of the sentences you've provided:

1. "She puts a table on his hair."
   - The subject noun is "She."

2. "George is very bored."
   - The subject noun is "George."

3. "Please let me know if this works."
   - This sentence is an imperative sentence (a command or request), and the subject noun is often implied as "you." However, since "you" is not explicitly mentioned, there is no subject noun clearly stated in the sentence.

Now, keep these subjects nouns, and change something in the sentence. 
For example, instead of "George is very bored", say "George was happy."

Make sure that the sentences make sense.
