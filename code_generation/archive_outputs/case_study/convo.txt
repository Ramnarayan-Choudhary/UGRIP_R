 --------------------------- TEACHER EXAM QUESTION -----------
This is a word puzzle, where there are two secret rules that encrypt the sentence.
    Can you guess those rules, then use Python script to simulate this?
Here are some examples:

Original Sentence: The cat sat on the mat.
Encrypted Sentence: The cat sat on the tam.

Original Sentence: Knowledge speaks louder than words.
Encrypted Sentence: Knowledge speaks reduol than sdrow.

Original Sentence: A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy rainbow.
Encrypted Sentence: A ynihs and nworb fox jumps over the yzal wobniar.

Original Sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy turtle.
Encrypted Sentence: The kciuq brown fox jumps over the yzal eltrut.

Original Sentence: I prefer guacamole over hummus.
Encrypted Sentence: I prefer elomacaug over summuh.

Original Sentence: You are doing a lot of work this weekend.
Encrypted Sentence: You are doing a lot of work this dnekeew.

First, carefully observe differences between the "original sentence" and "encrpted sentence".
Can you list a few ideas on how the sentences are encrypted?
Only give the list, no other content needed.

It's a language puzzle, so think about word tokenization, part of speech tagging, and sentence construction.
The sentences need to make grammatical sense and express complete meanings.


 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- STUDENT GUESSED PATTERNS --------------------------- 
Student Guessed Pattenrns:
1. Words with a certain length (possibly 3 or more letters) are reversed.
2. Specific parts of speech (like nouns, adjectives, adverbs) might be reversed while others remain the same.
3. The last word in the sentence is reversed.
4. Only words at certain positions in the sentence are reversed (e.g., every other word).
5. Words that are not function words (like "the", "on", "and", etc.) are reversed.
6. Words that are palindromes remain the same after encryption.

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- HINT #1 --------------------------- 
Common Mistakes:
1. The student has reversed the order of the characters in each word, rather than reversing the order of the words in the sentence or applying a specific transformation to certain words.
2. The student has included punctuation in the reversal, which should remain in its original position according to the teacher's output.
3. The student has not maintained the original capitalization of the words; instead, they have reversed the capitalization when reversing the characters.

Hints for Correction:
1. Focus on the transformation rule applied to specific words in the sentence rather than reversing the entire word. Look for a pattern in the words that have been changed in the teacher's output.
2. Keep punctuation in its original place. Do not reverse the punctuation along with the word characters.
3. Maintain the original capitalization of the sentence. If the first letter of a word is capitalized in the original sentence, ensure that it remains capitalized after applying the transformation.

Common Mistakes:
1. The student has reversed the entire words, including the first letter's capitalization, instead of reversing only specific words while maintaining the original sentence structure.
2. The student has reversed the order of the characters in each word, which is not consistent with the teacher's output where only certain words are reversed.      
3. The student has incorrectly reversed the order of the words in the sentence, which is not the pattern observed in the teacher's output.

Hints for Correction:
1. Identify which words are being reversed in the teacher's output and apply that same rule to the corresponding words in the original sentence.
2. Ensure that the sentence structure (word order) remains the same as in the original sentence.
3. Maintain the original capitalization of the sentence, only altering the order of the letters in the specific words that require it, as per the teacher's output.

Common Mistakes:
1. The student has reversed the entire words for all words in the sentence, rather than selectively reversing only the last word or specific words as shown in the teacher's output.
2. The student has included the punctuation in the reversal, which should remain in its original position according to the teacher's output.
3. The student has reversed the capitalization of the words, which should remain as in the original sentence.

Hints for Correction:
1. Only reverse the order of the letters in the last word of the sentence or in specific words that match the pattern in the teacher's output.
2. Keep punctuation in its original place at the end of the sentence.
3. Maintain the original capitalization of the sentence, ensuring that the first letter of the sentence and proper nouns remain capitalized.
