 --------------------------- TEACHER EXAM QUESTION -----------
This is a word puzzle, where there are two secret rules that encrypt the sentence.
    Can you guess those rules, then use Python script to simulate this?
Here are some examples:

Original Sentence: The cat sat on the mat.
Encrypted Sentence: The cat sat on the tam.

Original Sentence: Knowledge speaks louder than words.
Encrypted Sentence: Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.

Original Sentence: A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy rainbow.
Encrypted Sentence: A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.

Original Sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy turtle.
Encrypted Sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy eltrut.

Original Sentence: I prefer guacamole over hummus.
Encrypted Sentence: I prefer guacamole over summuh.

Original Sentence: You are doing a lot of work this weekend.
Encrypted Sentence: You are doing a lot of work this dnekeew.

First, carefully observe differences between the "original sentence" and "encrpted sentence".
Can you list a few ideas on how the sentences are encrypted?
Only give the list, no other content needed.

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- STUDENT GUESSED PATTERNS --------------------------- 
Student Guessed Pattenrns:
1. The last word of the sentence is reversed.
2. All other words in the sentence remain unchanged.
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- STUDENT STDOUT 1--------------------------- 
Golden: ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy eltrut.', 'I prefer guacamole over summuh.', 'You are doing a lot of work this dnekeew.']
Student: ['The cat sat on the .tam', 'Knowledge speaks louder than .sdrow', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy .wobniar', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy .eltrut', 'I prefer guacamole over .summuh', 'You are doing a lot of work this .dnekeew']

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- HINT #0 --------------------------- 
The student has added a period before the last word in each sentence. They should remove the period and ensure that the last word in each sentence is reversed without any additional punctuation.    
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- STUDENT STDOUT 2--------------------------- 
Golden: ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy eltrut.', 'I prefer guacamole over summuh.', 'You are doing a lot of work this dnekeew.']
Student: ['The cat sat on the .tam', 'Knowledge speaks louder than .sdrow', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy .wobniar', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy .eltrut', 'I prefer guacamole over .summuh', 'You are doing a lot of work this .dnekeew']

 ------------------------------------------------------------- 
 --------------------------- TEACHER EVAL --------------------------- 
The student has revised thier answer. Can you verify again?
   
    The original example:

    ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy eltrut.', 'I prefer guacamole over summuh.', 'You are doing a lot of work this dnekeew.']

    The student's answers:

    ['The cat sat on the .tam', 'Knowledge speaks louder than .sdrow', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy .wobniar', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy .eltrut', 'I prefer guacamole over .summuh', 'You are doing a lot of work this .dnekeew']


If the answers look correct, please answer "test passed". Otherwise, answer "try again".

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- PASS/FAIL ---------------------------
try again
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- HINT #2 ---------------------------
The student has incorrectly placed a period before the last word in each sentence. They should remove the period and ensure that the last word is simply reversed without any additional punctuation or spaces before it.

Golden: ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy eltrut.', 'I prefer guacamole over summuh.', 'You are doing a lot of work this dnekeew.']

 --------------------------- TEACHER EVAL #2 --------------------------- 
 --------------------------- PASS/FAIL #2 --------------------------- 
test passed
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------- TEST PASSED AT ITER #3. STUDENT COMMENT: --------------------------- 
The code follows these steps to encrypt the sentence according to the specified rules:

1. **Split the Sentence**: The sentence is split into a list of words using the `split()` method, which separates the sentence by spaces.

2. **Process the Last Word**: The last word in the list is identified. Any punctuation at the end of the last word (period, exclamation mark, or question mark) is removed using `rstrip()` to ensure that only the word itself is reversed.

3. **Reverse the Last Word**: The last word, now stripped of punctuation, is reversed using slicing (`[::-1]`). If there was punctuation at the end of the original last word, it is added back to the reversed word.

4. **Reconstruct the Sentence**: The modified last word replaces the original last word in the list of words. The list is then joined back into a sentence using `join()` with spaces.

5. **Return the Encrypted Sentence**: The newly constructed sentence, with the last word reversed, is returned as the encrypted sentence.

Here are a few new example pairs to test the code:

Original Sentence: "Encryption can be fun."
Encrypted Sentence: "Encryption can be nuf."

Original Sentence: "Let's have a picnic tomorrow."
Encrypted Sentence: "Let's have a picnic worromot."

Original Sentence: "Python programming is versatile."
Encrypted Sentence: "Python programming is elitresrev."

Original Sentence: "Remember to save your work frequently."
Encrypted Sentence: "Remember to save your work yltneuqerf."

Original Sentence: "The encryption algorithm is robust."
Encrypted Sentence: "The encryption algorithm is tsubor."

----- PASSED AT ITER #3. The final outputs are: ------------
Golden: ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.', 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy eltrut.', 'I prefer guacamole over summuh.', 'You are doing a lot of work this dnekeew.']
