 --------------------------- TEACHER EXAMPLES ---------------------------
This is a word puzzle, where there are two secret rules that encrypt the sentence. Can you guess those rules, then use Python script to simulate this?

here are some examples:

Original Sentence: The cat sat on the mat.
Engrypted Sentence: The cat sat on the tam.

Original Sentence: Knowledge speaks louder than words.
Engrypted Sentence: Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.

Original Sentence: A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy rainbow.
Engrypted Sentence: A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.



Please fill in this python skeleton code. Only add the necessary code to the function "encrypt_sentence".
Make sure to also keep the "examples" and for loop. Do not use any new Python modules other than the ones provided.


import nltk
from nltk import pos_tag
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def encrypt_sentence(example):

    # TODO: using the nltk module, construct the "new_sentence" that can encrypt each sentence from "examples".

    return new_sentence

# Examples
examples = [
    "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "Knowledge speaks louder than words.",
    "A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
]

answers = []
for example in examples:
    answers.append(encrypt_sentence(example))

# Save the list to JSON
with open("student_answers.json", "w", encoding='utf-8') as json_file:
    json.dump(answers, json_file)

print(answers)


Only return the Python code itself. No other explanations needed.

 --------------------------- STUDENT STDOUT 1--------------------------- 
Golden: ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.']
Student: ['The tac sat on the tam.', 'egdelwonK speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown xof spmuj over the lazy god.']

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- HINT FIRST --------------------------- 
1. Look for words in the student's answer that are reversed and correct them to match the teacher's output.
2. Pay attention to the spelling of words that are meant to be reversed and ensure they are mirrored accurately.
3. Identify and correct any words that are not appropriately reversed or are misspelled compared to the teacher's output.

 --------------------------- STUDENT STDOUT 2--------------------------- 
Golden: ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.']
Student: ['The tac sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown xof spmuj over the lazy god.']

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- TEACHER EVAL ---------------------------
The student has revised thier answer. Can you verify again?

    The original example:

    ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.']

    The student's answers:

    ['The tac sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown xof spmuj over the lazy god.']


If the answers look correct, please answer "test passed". Otherwise, answer "try again".

 --------------------------- PASS/FAIL ---------------------------
try again
 -------------------------------------------------------------
Student needs to try again.
 --------------------------- NEW HINT 3--------------------------- 
1. Check the order of the letters in the first word of the first sentence; they should match the teacher's output.
2. In the last sentence, ensure that the last word is reversed correctly to match the teacher's output.
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- STUDENT STDOUT 3--------------------------- 
Golden: ['The cat sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.']
Student: ['The tac sat on the tam.', 'Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.', 'A shiny and brown xof spmuj over the lazy god.']

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- PASS/FAIL 3 --------------------------- 
try again
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------- NEW HINT 4---------------------------
1. Reverse the first word in the first sentence to match the teacher's output.
2. In the third sentence, the last word should be a reversed version of a word that means the opposite of "dog."
