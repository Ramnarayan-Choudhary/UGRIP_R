 --------------------------- TEACHER EXAMPLES --------------------------- 
This is a word puzzle, where there are two secret rules that encrypt the sentence. Can you guess those rules, then use Python script to simulate this?

here are some examples:

Original Sentence: The cat sat on the mat.
Engrypted Sentence: The cat sat on the tam.

Original Sentence: Knowledge speaks louder than words.
Engrypted Sentence: Knowledge speaks louder than sdrow.

Original Sentence: A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy rainbow.
Engrypted Sentence: A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy wobniar.



Please fill in this python skeleton code. Make sure to also keep the "examples" and for loop.


import nltk
from nltk import pos_tag
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def encrypt_sentence(example):

    # TODO: using the nltk module, construct the "new_sentence" that can encrypt each sentence from "examples".

    return new_sentence

# Examples
examples = [
    "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "Knowledge speaks louder than words.",
    "A shiny and brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
]

answers = []
for example in examples:
    answers.append(encrypt_sentence(example))


# Save the list to JSON
with open("student_answers.json", "w", encoding='utf-8') as json_file:
    json.dump(answers, json_file)

print(answers)




Only return the Python code itself. No other explanations needed.

 --------------------------- HINT FIRST ---------------------------
1. Check the spelling of the words where the letters within the words seem to be reversed.
2. Look for words that are reversed and correct them to match the forward spelling.
3. Identify and correct the words that are not spelled correctly, paying attention to the order of the letters.
