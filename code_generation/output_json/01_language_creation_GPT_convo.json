    "Prompt 1": "Certainly! Below is a Python function that takes an English sentence, identifies the subject nouns, reverses their spelling, and places them at the end of the sentence. For simplicity, we'll assume that the subject noun is the first noun in the sentence and that it is a single word. In English, subject identification can be complex, but for this example, we'll use a basic approach.\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk import pos_tag\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n\n# Download the necessary NLTK models (if not already downloaded)\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n\ndef is_noun(tag):\n    return tag in ['NN', 'NNS', 'NNP', 'NNPS']\n\ndef reverse_subject(sentence):\n    # Tokenize the sentence into words\n    words = word_tokenize(sentence)\n    # Tag parts of speech\n    tagged_words = pos_tag(words)\n    \n    # Find the first noun in the sentence as the subject\n    subject = None\n    for word, tag in tagged_words:\n        if is_noun(tag):\n            subject = word\n            break\n    \n    if not subject:\n        raise ValueError(\"No subject noun found in the sentence.\")\n    \n    # Reverse the subject\n    reversed_subject = subject[::-1]\n    \n    # Remove the subject from its original position\n    words.remove(subject)\n    \n    # Construct the new sentence with the reversed subject at the end\n    new_sentence = ' '.join(words) + ' ' + reversed_subject\n    \n    return new_sentence\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_sentence = \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\nencrypted_sentence = reverse_subject(original_sentence)\nprint(encrypted_sentence)\n```\n\nThis code uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to tokenize the sentence and tag each word with its part of speech. It then identifies the first noun as the subject, reverses it, and constructs a new sentence with the reversed subject at the end.\n\nPlease note that this is a very simplistic approach to identifying the subject of a sentence. In reality, subject identification can be much more complex and may require more sophisticated natural language processing techniques. Additionally, this code assumes that the subject is a single word and does not handle compound subjects or subjects that are phrases.",
    "Prompt 2": "Sure, here is the code without the markdown formatting:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk import pos_tag\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n\n# Download the necessary NLTK models (if not already downloaded)\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n\ndef is_noun(tag):\n    return tag in ['NN', 'NNS', 'NNP', 'NNPS']\n\ndef reverse_subject(sentence):\n    # Tokenize the sentence into words\n    words = word_tokenize(sentence)\n    # Tag parts of speech\n    tagged_words = pos_tag(words)\n    \n    # Find the first noun in the sentence as the subject\n    subject = None\n    for word, tag in tagged_words:\n        if is_noun(tag):\n            subject = word\n            break\n    \n    if not subject:\n        raise ValueError(\"No subject noun found in the sentence.\")\n    \n    # Reverse the subject\n    reversed_subject = subject[::-1]\n    \n    # Remove the subject from its original position\n    words.remove(subject)\n    \n    # Construct the new sentence with the reversed subject at the end\n    new_sentence = ' '.join(words) + ' ' + reversed_subject\n    \n    return new_sentence\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_sentence = \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\nencrypted_sentence = reverse_subject(original_sentence)\nprint(encrypted_sentence)\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this code into a Python script or an interactive Python session to run it on your local machine. Make sure you have NLTK installed and the required NLTK data downloaded as indicated in the code.",
    "Prompt 3": "Certainly! Here are 10 simple sentence pairs where the first sentence is in standard English and the second sentence is the translation into your invented language, following the rules you've provided:\n\n1. Original: The dog barks loudly.\n   Translated: Barks loudly god.\n\n2. Original: A bird flies over the trees.\n   Translated: Flies over the trees drib.\n\n3. Original: Children play in the park.\n   Translated: Play in the park nerdlihc.\n\n4. Original: The teacher explains the lesson.\n   Translated: Explains the lesson rehcaet.\n\n5. Original: A fish swims in the aquarium.\n   Translated: Swims in the aquarium hsif.\n\n6. Original: The student reads a book.\n   Translated: Reads a book tneduts.\n\n7. Original: The artist paints a beautiful picture.\n   Translated: Paints a beautiful picture tsitra.\n\n8. Original: The chef cooks delicious meals.\n   Translated: Cooks delicious meals fehc.\n\n9. Original: The sun rises in the east.\n   Translated: Rises in the east nus.\n\n10. Original: The moon shines at night.\n    Translated: Shines at night noom.\n\nThese translations follow the rules you've set: the subject noun is reversed and placed at the end of the sentence, while the rest of the sentence structure remains the same."
