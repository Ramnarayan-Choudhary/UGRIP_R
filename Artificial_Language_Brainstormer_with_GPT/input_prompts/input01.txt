Topic: Translating the Task

>>>> Prompt 1 >>>>
Here is a raw text answer containing English sentences and their translations in another language:

    <raw_text_answer>
    Ngarlu nya. You.SG danced.
 Gulugba ngu. I will sleep.
    </raw_text_answer>

    Your task is to extract the relevant information from this raw text and use it to fill in the following JSON template:

    <json_template>
    {
 "test": [
  [
   "lavatbungmenemen",
   "big group of villages",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "laradi",
   "man",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "lavatkonuna",
   "big branch",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "laxantoonan",
   "many spirits",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "levengkatli",
   "eyes",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "loxot",
   "place",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "lubungkavus",
   "group of white men",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "luvaroos",
   "two big vines",
   ">"
  ],
  [
   "leveve",
   "heart",
   "<"
  ],
  [
   "leventaamang",
   "gardens",
   "<"
  ],
  [
   "laxampanga",
   "many things",
   "<"
  ],
  [
   "luvuttubuno",
   "grandchildren",
   "<"
  ],
  [
   "luxonaleng",
   "two parts of day",
   "<"
  ],
  [
   "lengkonuna",
   "branches",
   "<"
  ],
  [
   "lempatkonuna",
   "big branches",
   "<"
  ]
 ]
}
    </json_template>

    You only need to fill in `test` section of the JSON template. Do not change anything in other sections. Return the whole JSON template with the `test` section filled in.

    To complete this task:

    1. Carefully read through the raw text answer and identify each sentence pair, consisting of an English sentence and its translation.

    2. For each sentence pair, determine the direction of translation:
    - If the English sentence is listed first, followed by the translation, the direction is English to the other language. Indicate this with a "<" symbol.
    - If the translation is listed first, followed by the English sentence, the direction is from the other language to English. Indicate this with a ">" symbol.

    3. Fill in the JSON template with the sentence pairs in the following format:
    ["sentence_1", "sentence_2", "direction_symbol"]
    - sentence_1 should be the sentence in the original language (either English or the other language)
    - sentence_2 should be the translated sentence 
    - direction_symbol should be either "<" for English to other language or ">" for other language to English

    4. If there is no "sentence_2" corresponding to "sentence_1", set "sentence_2" = ""

    5. Make sure the completed JSON follows this structure:
    {"test": [
        ["sentence_1", "sentence_2", "direction_symbol"],
        ["sentence_1", "sentence_2", "direction_symbol"],
        ...
    ]}

    6. Output the completed JSON, strictly follow the structure of the JSON template.

    Please generate your full response, properly formatted in the specified JSON structure, immediately after this instruction with no further prompting. Do not preface your response with any extraneous text - simply output the JSON. Maintain the original JSON formatting.
