Topic: Creating a new language (Expert Version)
Author: Joy Yeh

>>>> Prompt 1: Language Requirements >>>>
I am designing a new language with the following requirements.
1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.
2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: "dog", "thirsty", "chases", "paper", "yellow", "humans".
3. It will have completely different grammar rules as English. Be creative! For example, the order of words, the verb conjugations, etc. can all be different.
Imagine you're a linguistics expert.
Can you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose. Make them a non-standard alphabet, be creative. It can be a mixture of multiple language's alphabets too. 
I want the language to look and sound cool!
