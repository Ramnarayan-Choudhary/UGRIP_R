Topic: Creating a new language (Expert Version)
Author: Joy Yeh

>>>> Prompt 1: Language Requirements >>>>
I am designing a new language with the following requirements.
1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.
2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: "dog", "thirsty", "chases", "paper", "yellow", "humans".
3. It will have completely different grammar rules as English. Be creative! For example, the order of words, the verb conjugations, etc. can all be different.
Imagine you're a linguistics expert.
Can you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose. Make them a non-standard alphabet, be creative. It can be a mixture of multiple language's alphabets too. 
I want the language to look and sound cool!

Certainly! Here's a unique and cool 20-letter alphabet for your new language:

1. Ψ (Psi) 
2. ғ (F with descender)
3. Ћ (T with stroke)
4. Ƨ (Esh)
5. ʘ (Open O)
6. Ɯ (Wynn)
7. Ӿ (Kha)
8. Ʀ (R with stroke)
9. Щ (Shcha)

17. Ӊ (En with descender)
18. Ҷ (Che with descender)
19. ҈ (A with breve)

This alphabet incorporates a mixture of Cyrillic, IPA, and unique characters to create a visually appealing and distinctive script.

Verb Tenses and Grammar Rules in the New Language:

1. Verb Tenses:
   - Present tense: ҈ (Third person singular) + Ʌ (infinitive verb form) + Subject
   - Past tense: Ҷ (Third person singular) + Ҁ (past participle) + Subject
   - Negative form: Ҝ (auxiliary verb for negation) + Verb + Subject

2. Vocabulary:
   - "dog" = ӉƜӢƦ
   - "thirsty" = ҈ƧҖƧƩƧ
   - "chases" = ҈ƩƜƦ
   - "paper" = ҈ƦʘӁƦ
   - "yellow" = ҀʘƦƩƧ
   - "humans" = ғӉƩӢʘ

3. Grammar Rules:
   - The verb comes before the subject in the present tense.
   - The verb comes after the subject in the past tense.
   - To form a negative sentence, the auxiliary verb "Ҝ" is used before the verb.

Reasons for the Differences from English:
1. The order of words in the sentence is different to make the language distinct and to express meaning in a unique way.
2. The verb conjugations and negative form are different
