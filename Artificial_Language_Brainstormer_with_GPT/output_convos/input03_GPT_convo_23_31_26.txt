Topic: Creating a new language (Expert Version)
Author: Joy Yeh

>>>> Prompt 1: Language Requirements >>>>
I am designing a new language with the following requirements.
1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.
2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: "dog", "thirsty", "chases", "paper", "yellow", "humans".
3. It will have completely different grammar rules as English. Be creative! For example, the order of words, the verb conjugations, etc. can all be different.
Imagine you're a linguistics expert.
Can you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose. Make them a non-standard alphabet, be creative. It can be a mixture of multiple language's alphabets too. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-----------------------------------------
Certainly! Here's a unique 20-letter alphabet for your new language:

1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F
7. G
8. H
9. I
10. J
11. K
12. L
13. M
14. N
15. O
16. P
17. Q
18. R
19. S
20. T

For the distinct vocabulary words:
1. "dog" could be represented by the letter "A".
2. "thirsty" could be represented by the letter "K".
3. "chases" could be represented by the letters "EJ".
4. "paper" could be represented by the letter "Q".
5. "yellow" could be represented by the letter "G".
6. "humans" could be represented by the letters "FL".

For the grammar rules, here's a creative suggestion:
- The order of words in a sentence could follow a subject-verb-object pattern, but with the object coming before the subject and verb.
- Verb conjugations could be indicated by adding prefixes to the verb, rather than changing the ending of the verb.

I hope these suggestions help in creating a unique and interesting new language!

>>>> Prompt 3: Reasoning >>>>
Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified. 
In addition to the vocab, please come up with the verb tenses, grammar rules.
Explain as if you're teaching a student this new language. 
Make sure that the rules are different from that of English. 
Include a main linguistic phenomenon, which is something unique about the language. 
Please explain step by step.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-----------------------------------------
Step 1: Verb Tenses
In this new language, verb tenses are indicated by adding prefixes to the verb. For example:
- Present tense: Use the base form of the verb without any prefixes.
- Past tense: Add the prefix "Z" before the base form of the verb.
- Future tense: Add the prefix "V" before the base form of the verb.

Step 2: Grammar Rules
- The word order in a sentence is Object-Subject-Verb. This means that the object of the sentence comes first, followed by the subject, and then the verb.
- For example, the English sentence "The dog chases the paper" would be translated into the new language as "Q FL EJ A".
- Adjectives come after the noun they describe. For example, "yellow paper" would be "Q G".

Main Linguistic Phenomenon
In this language, there is a unique phenomenon called "Verbal Prefix Agreement". This means that the prefix added to the verb changes depending on the subject of the sentence. For example, if the subject is "humans", the prefix "G" is added to the verb to indicate agreement.

I hope this helps you understand the verb tenses, grammar rules, and the unique linguistic phenomenon of this new language!

>>>> Prompt 4: Sentence Translations >>>>
Apply the vocabulary and grammar rules you mentioned in the previous response, 
now we can translate the 4 sentences below.

"The dog is thirsty."
"The paper disappeared and turned yellow."
"Humans don't usually chase dogs."
"Paper doesn't get thirsty".

Then, explain what grammar rules you used, and why you provided an unambiguous translation to each problem.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-----------------------------------------
The translations for the sentences using the vocabulary and grammar rules are as follows:

1. "The dog is thirsty." 
   Translation: "K FL V"

2. "The paper disappeared and turned yellow."
   Translation: "Q FL ZM G"

3. "Humans don't usually chase dogs."
   Translation: "FL VJ Z A EJ"

4. "Paper doesn't get thirsty."
   Translation: "Q Z A V"

Explanation of Grammar Rules:
- The word order in a sentence is Object-Subject-Verb.
- Verb tenses are indicated by adding prefixes to the verb: "V" for future tense, "Z" for past tense, and no prefix for the present tense.
- In sentence 2, the adjectives "disappeared" and "turned yellow" come after the object "paper" to follow the grammar rule.
- The main linguistic phenomenon, "Verbal Prefix Agreement", is used to indicate the subject of the sentence, such as "VJ" agreeing with "FL" in sentence 3.

The translations are unambiguous because the grammar rules and the unique linguistic phenomenon ensure that the meaning of each word and the structure of each sentence is clear and follows the rules of the new language.
