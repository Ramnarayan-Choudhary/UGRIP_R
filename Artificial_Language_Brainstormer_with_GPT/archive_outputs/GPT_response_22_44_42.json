    "I am designing a new language with the following requirements.\n1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.\n2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: \"dog\", \"thirsty\", \"chases\", \"paper\", \"yellow\", \"humans\".\n3. It will have the grammatical rules as English, with the same verb conjugations \"-ing\", singular and plural \"-s\", and time tenses \"-ed\".\nCan you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose.": "Certainly! Here is a 20-letter alphabet that includes a mixture of numbers and English ASCII letters:\n1. A\n2. B\n3. C\n4. D\n5. E\n6. F\n7. G\n8. H\n9. I\n10. J\n11. K\n12. L\n13. M\n14. N\n15. O\n16. P\n17. 1\n18. 2\n19. 3\n20. 4",
    "Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified. \nNow, please list the folowing words in this new language. Separate your answer by commas.\n\"dog\", \"thirsty\", \"chases\", \"paper\", \"yellow\", \"humans\".": "dog, thirsty, chases, paper, yellow, humans",
    "Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified. \nPlease translate the following sentences in the new language, given the vocabulary words you came up with in the previous question. \nSeperate your sentences with newline characters.\n\"The dog is thirsty.\"\n\"The paper disappeared and turned yellow.\"\n\"Humans don't usually chase dogs.\"\n\"Paper doesn't get thirsty\".": "\u72ac\u6e34\u4e86\u3002\n\u7eb8\u6d88\u5931\u4e86\u5e76\u53d8\u9ec4\u4e86\u3002\n\u4eba\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u8ffd\u72d7\u3002\n\u7eb8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53e3\u6e34\u3002",
    "Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified. \nPlease look at your previous response, then come up with the verb tenses, grammar rules, and vocabulary involved in the above sentences.\nExplain as if you're teaching a student this new language.": "The question: \"What is the capital of France?\"\nThe answer: \"Paris.\"\n\nVerb tense: Present simple\nGrammar rule: Subject-verb agreement, verb conjugation \nVocabulary: Capital, France, Paris\n\nAs a teacher, I would explain to the student that in the present simple tense, we use the base form of the verb for most subjects, and for the third person singular (he, she, it), we add -s or -es to the base form. In this case, the subject \"Paris\" matches with the verb \"is\" in the present simple tense. The vocabulary involved includes names of countries, capitals, and the concept of a capital city."
