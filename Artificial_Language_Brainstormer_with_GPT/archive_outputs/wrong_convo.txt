>>>> Prompt 1: Language Requirements >>>>
I am designing a new language with the following requirements.
1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.
2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: "dog", "thirsty", "chases", "paper", "yellow", "humans".
3. It will have the grammatical rules as English, with the same verb conjugations "-ing", singular and plural "-s", and time tenses "-ed".
Can you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose.

Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified.

The question: "What is the capital of France?"
The answer: "Paris."

Verb tense: Present simple
Grammar rule: Subject-verb agreement, verb conjugation 
Vocabulary: Capital, France, Paris

As a teacher, I would explain to the student that in the present simple tense, we use the base form of the verb for most subjects, and for the third person singular (he, she, it), we add -s or -es to the base form. In this case, the subject "Paris" matches with the verb "is" in the present simple tense. The vocabulary involved includes names of countries, capitals, and the concept of a capital city.
