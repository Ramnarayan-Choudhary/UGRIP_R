>>>> Prompt 1: Language Requirements >>>>
I am designing a new language with the following requirements.
1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.
2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: "dog", "thirsty", "chases", "paper", "yellow", "humans".
3. It will have the grammatical rules as English, with the same verb conjugations "-ing", singular and plural "-s", and time tenses "-ed".
Can you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose.

5. E
6. F
7. G
8. H
9. I

Please look at your previous response, then come up with the verb tenses, grammar rules, and vocabulary involved in the above sentences.

-----------------------------------------
Certainly! In the new language, we use the following grammar rules and vocabulary:

Verb tenses:
- Present tense: Indicates actions happening now. For example, "The dog is thirsty" is translated as "TH3 D1G 1S TH1RSTY."
- Past tense: Indicates actions that have already happened. For example, "The paper disappeared and turned yellow" is translated as "TH3 P4P3R D1S4PP34R3D 4ND TURN3D Y3LL0W."
- Negative form: To express negation. For example, "Humans don't usually chase dogs" is translated as "HUM4NS D0N'T USU4LLY CH4S3 D1GS."
- Negative form with auxiliary verb "do": Used to form negative sentences. For example, "Paper doesn't get thirsty" is translated as "P4P3R D03SN'T G3T TH1RSTY."

Vocabulary:
- "dog" is represented as "D1G"
- "thirsty" is represented as "TH1RSTY"
- "chases" is represented as "CH4S3S"
- "paper" is represented as "P4P3R"
- "yellow" is represented as "Y3LL0W"
- "humans" is represented as "HUM4NS"

By following these rules and vocabulary, we can form sentences in the new language.
