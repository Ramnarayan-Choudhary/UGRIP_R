>>>> Prompt 1: Language Requirements >>>>
I am designing a new language with the following requirements.
1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.
2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: "dog", "thirsty", "chases", "paper", "yellow", "humans".
3. It will have the grammatical rules as English, with the same verb conjugations "-ing", singular and plural "-s", and time tenses "-ed".
Can you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose.
