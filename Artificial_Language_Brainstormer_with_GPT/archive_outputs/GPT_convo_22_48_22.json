    "I am designing a new language with the following requirements.\n1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.\n2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: \"dog\", \"thirsty\", \"chases\", \"paper\", \"yellow\", \"humans\".\n3. It will have the grammatical rules as English, with the same verb conjugations \"-ing\", singular and plural \"-s\", and time tenses \"-ed\".\nCan you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose.": "Certainly! Here's a 20-letter alphabet that includes a mix of numbers and English ASCII letters as per your requirements:\n\n1. A\n2. B\n3. C\n4. D\n5. E\n6.
