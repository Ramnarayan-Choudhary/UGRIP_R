    "I am designing a new language with the following requirements.\n1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.\n2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: \"dog\", \"thirsty\", \"chases\", \"paper\", \"yellow\", \"humans\".\n3. It will have the grammatical rules as English, with the same verb conjugations \"-ing\", singular and plural \"-s\", and time tenses \"-ed\".\nCan you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose.": "Sure, here's a suggestion for a 20-letter alphabet that includes a mixture of numbers and English ASCII letters:\n\n1. A\n2. B\n3. C\n4. D\n5. E\n6. F\n7. G\n8. H\n9. I\n10. J\n11. K\n12. L\n13. M\n14. N\n15. O\n16. P\n17. Q\n18. R\n19. 1\n20. 2\n\nThis alphabet includes a mix of English letters and numbers, which can be used to create distinct vocabulary words for your new language.",
    "Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified. \nNow, please list the folowing words in this new language. Separate your answer by commas.\n\"dog\", \"thirsty\", \"chases\", \"paper\", \"yellow\", \"humans\".": "D1G, TH1RSTY, CH4S3S, P4P3R, Y3LL0W, HUM4NS",
    "Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified. \nPlease translate the following sentences in the new language, given the vocabulary words you came up with in the previous question. \nSeperate your sentences with newline characters.\n\"The dog is thirsty.\"\n\"The paper disappeared and turned yellow.\"\n\"Humans don't usually chase dogs.\"\n\"Paper doesn't get thirsty\".": "TH3 D1G 1S TH1RSTY.\nTH3 P4P3R D1S4PP34R3D 4ND TURN3D Y3LL0W.\nHUM4NS D0N'T USU4LLY CH4S3 D1GS.\nP4P3R D03SN'T G3T TH1RSTY.",
    "Answer the question directly without extra sentences, in the exact formats specified. \nPlease look at your previous response, then come up with the verb tenses, grammar rules, and vocabulary involved in the above sentences.\nExplain as if you're teaching a student this new language.": "Certainly! In the new language, we use the following grammar rules and vocabulary:\n\nVerb tenses:\n- Present tense: Indicates actions happening now. For example, \"The dog is thirsty\" is translated as \"TH3 D1G 1S TH1RSTY.\"\n- Past tense: Indicates actions that have already happened. For example, \"The paper disappeared and turned yellow\" is translated as \"TH3 P4P3R D1S4PP34R3D 4ND TURN3D Y3LL0W.\"\n- Negative form: To express negation. For example, \"Humans don't usually chase dogs\" is translated as \"HUM4NS D0N'T USU4LLY CH4S3 D1GS.\"\n- Negative form with auxiliary verb \"do\": Used to form negative sentences. For example, \"Paper doesn't get thirsty\" is translated as \"P4P3R D03SN'T G3T TH1RSTY.\"\n\nVocabulary:\n- \"dog\" is represented as \"D1G\"\n- \"thirsty\" is represented as \"TH1RSTY\"\n- \"chases\" is represented as \"CH4S3S\"\n- \"paper\" is represented as \"P4P3R\"\n- \"yellow\" is represented as \"Y3LL0W\"\n- \"humans\" is represented as \"HUM4NS\"\n\nBy following these rules and vocabulary, we can form sentences in the new language."
