    "I am designing a new language with the following requirements.\n1. The alphabet should have 20 letters. They can be a mixture of numbers or English ASCII letters.\n2. The language should have distinct vocabulary words for the following words: \"dog\", \"thirsty\", \"chases\", \"paper\", \"yellow\", \"humans\".\n3. It will have completely different grammar rules as English. Be creative! For example, the order of words, the verb conjugations, etc. can all be different.\nImagine you're a linguistics expert.\nCan you design the Alphabet for me? List out all 20 letters you choose. Make them a non-standard alphabet, be creative. It can be a mixture of multiple language's alphabets too. \nI want the language to look and sound cool!": "Certainly! Here's a unique and cool 20-letter alphabet for your new language:\n\n1. \u03a8 (Psi) \n2. \u0493 (F with descender)\n3. \u040b (T with stroke)\n4. \u01a7 (Esh)\n5. \u0298 (Open O)\n6. \u019c (Wynn)\n7. \u04fe (Kha)\n8. \u01a6 (R with stroke)\n9. \u0429 (Shcha)\n10. \u0166 (T with stroke)\n11. \u04e2 (I with macron)\n12. \u01b5 (Z with stroke)\n13. \u0496 (Zhe with descender)\n14. \u04a4 (H with stroke)\n15. \u01a9 (Ezh)\n16. \u0480 (Yat)\n17. \u04c9 (En with descender)\n18. \u04b6 (Che with descender)\n19. \u0488 (A with breve)\n20. \u04c1 (Z with descender)\n\nThis alphabet incorporates a mixture of Cyrillic, IPA, and unique characters to create a visually appealing and distinctive script.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance with the vocabulary and grammar rules!",

Please explain step by step.": "Verb Tenses and Grammar Rules in the New Language:\n\n1. Verb Tenses:\n   - Present tense: \u0488 (Third person singular) + \u0245 (infinitive verb form) + Subject\n   - Past tense: \u04b6 (Third person singular) + \u0480 (past participle) + Subject\n   - Negative form: \u049c (auxiliary verb for negation) + Verb + Subject\n\n2. Vocabulary:\n   - \"dog\" = \u04c9\u019c\u04e2\u01a6\n   - \"thirsty\" = \u0488\u01a7\u0496\u01a7\u01a9\u01a7\n   - \"chases\" = \u0488\u01a9\u019c\u01a6\n   - \"paper\" = \u0488\u01a6\u0298\u04c1\u01a6\n   - \"yellow\" = \u0480\u0298\u01a6\u01a9\u01a7\n   - \"humans\" = \u0493\u04c9\u01a9\u04e2\u0298\n\n3. Grammar Rules:\n   - The verb comes before the subject in the present tense.\n   - The verb comes after the subject in the past tense.\n   - To form a negative sentence, the auxiliary verb \"\u049c\" is used before the verb.\n\nReasons for the Differences from English:\n1. The order of words in the sentence is different to make the language distinct and to express meaning in a unique way.\n2. The verb conjugations and negative form are different"
