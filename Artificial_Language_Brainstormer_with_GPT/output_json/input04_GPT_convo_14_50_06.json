    "\"This is a linguistics puzzle.

The letter \u00f1 is pronounced like the sound in the middle of \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d or \u201conion\u201d. The letter y is pronounced like the \u201cu\u201d in \u201ccut\u201d. The letter j and the apostrophe (\u2018) are specific consonants.\nSource and Target:\njapyhyta\t:We will be catching\nnohyvyk\u00f5iri\t:He is not enjoying\nombokapu\t:He is shooting\npemomaitei\t:You.PL are greeting\nndokarumo'\u00e3i\t:He will not be eating\nndapevo'oima\t:You.PL were not taking\nnapekoror\u00f5mo'\u00e3i\t:You.PL will not be crying\nno\u00f1e'e\u0342 i\t:He is not talking\nokoror\u00f5\t:He is crying\nndajajupirima\t:We were not waking up\nahyvyk\u00f5ima\t:I was enjoying\na\u00f1e'e\u0342 ta\t:I will be talking\nnamomaiteiri\t:I am not greeting\njapurahei\t:We are singing\n\nGiven the above expressions, please translate the following statements:\nEnglish to guaran\u00ed:\nYou.PL are not shooting\nHe is not singing\nWe will be eating\nI will not be singing\n\nguaran\u00ed to English:\nakaruma\nojupita\nndavo'omo'\u00e3i\nnapekoror\u00f5i\nndapyhyima": "English to guaran\u00ed:\nYou.PL are not shooting - nohyvyk\u00f5mo'\u00e3i\nHe is not singing - nojupito\nWe will be eating - ndavo'omo'\u00e3i\nI will not be singing - napekoror\u00f5i\n\nguaran\u00ed to English:\nakaruma - I will be eating\nojupita - We are waking up\nndavo'omo'\u00e3i - You.PL will not be taking\nnapekoror\u00f5i - I will be crying\nndapyhyima - You.PL were catching",
